<strong>"Cattle Caller"</strong>

This website is an interactive design, for the cattle enthusiast and the non cattle enthusiast. 
This app allows its users to view pictures and details of various cattle of either interest or research purposes.
Also, the user has the ability to edit a list of cattle that is preloaded and add a cattle breed of their own if 
they so choose to.
